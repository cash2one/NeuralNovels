# Neural Novels
Repo for [my work on NaNoGenMo 2017](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017/issues/98).

## Progress so far
* A 99,965 word "novel" created using a 2-layer char rnn trained on G.A. Henty novels. The semi-readable output is [here](https://supermdguy.github.io/NeuralNovels/gru_baseline.pdf).
* A 50,000 word "novel" created using a 3-layer word based rnn trained on all of G.A. Henty's novels. I need to do some more tuning, because it just outputs variations of "I don't think so". You can read it [here](https://github.com/superMDguy/NeuralNovels/blob/5bbd327120067d884eebefa130be955a78851d15/i_don't_think_so.md).
